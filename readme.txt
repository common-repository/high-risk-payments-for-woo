== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I obtain a Cardpay Solutions gateway and merchant account? =

[Click Here](https://www.cardpaysolutions.com/woocommerce?pid=317d5f0aa67f1638) to register for a low cost account.

= How do I get my Username and Password? =

Call sales support at (866) 913-3220 and we can assist you.

= How do I test the plugin before going live? =

The plugin has a built-in test mode. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> Cardpay Solutions
and check the "Use Sandbox" box and then click the "Save Changes" button. The Username and Password fields are
not required in sandbox mode and can be left blank.

The following test cards can be used in Sandbox Mode with any future expiration date:

* Visa 4111111111111111
* MasterCard 5431111111111111
* American Express 341111111111111
* Discover 6011601160116611

= Can I use the plugin without the stored credit card features? =

Yes. Navigate to the configuration page at WooCommerce -> Settings -> Checkout -> Cardpay Solutions and uncheck the "Allow Stored Cards"
box and save your changes. Customers will then not see the option to save cards for future use in the checkout and will not see any stored credit
card information on the My Account page.

= What is the difference between the "Authorize Only" and "Authorize & Capture" transaction types? =

The Authorize Only transaction type reserves the amount of the transaction on the customer's credit card but does not start the process of
transferring the funds to your bank account until a separate "Capture" request is sent to the gateway. The capture request can be 
automatically sent when the order status is changed to "Completed" by enabling the "Auto Capture" feature in the configuration or by
logging into your Cardpay Solutions gateway account and manually requesting the capture from there.

The Authorize & Capture transaction type authorizes the transaction and then automatically captures it at your designated batch cut-off
time each day. This starts the process of moving the funds to your bank account.
